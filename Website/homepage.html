                    <p>
                        <b>Cyber security is how individuals and organisations reduce the risk of cyberattack.</b>
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        Cyber security's core function is to protect the devices we all use (smartphones, laptops, tablets and computers), and the services we access - both online and at work - from theft or damage.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        It's also about preventing unauthorised access to the vast amounts of personal information we store on these devices, and online.
                        Why is it important?
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        Cyber security is important because smartphones, computers and the internet are now such a fundamental part of modern life, that it's difficult to imagine how we'd function without them. From online banking and shopping, to email and social media, it's more important than ever to take steps that can prevent cyber criminals getting hold of our accounts, data, and devices.

                                Some of the ways to protect personal information and enhance cyber security are:<br/>
                                Use a strong and separate password for your email and other online accounts. You can use
                                a password manager to help you create and store passwords securely. Passwords are the
                                first line of defence against unauthorised access to your accounts and data. Using weak
                                or reused passwords can make it easy for cyber criminals to guess or crack them.
                                Password managers are ...
