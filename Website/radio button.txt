national curriculum suggestion for key stage 3:  understand a range of ways to use technology safely, respectfully, responsibly and
securely, including protecting their online identity and privacy; recognise inappropriate
content, contact and conduct and know how to report concerns.

Ok I will start working on the webpage Next Wednesday, I will setup the pages and get some style on it, I would tho like to get the main page design from all of you so that we can have something to document on.
Tupd — 08/03/2023 11:45
Possible idea for layout

what is the smaller webpage supposed to mean?
Nevermind I think I know what you mean

This is just bookmarking a useful Java webpage: https://web.dev/drag-and-drop/
web.dev
Using the HTML5 Drag and Drop API
The HTML5 Drag and Drop API means that we can make almost any element on our page draggable. In this post we’ll explain the basics of drag and drop.

Just going add that JavaScript functionally should be finished by next week latest, just need to tweak one or two things, so that it is no longer spaghetti code
Tupd — 03/05/2023 09:37
ok this will take a bit longer hopefully Thursday-ish, as I made the mistake of not attempting not testing the code on the webserver, (can't tell exactly, but it seems to be an error of "Cross-Origin Request Blocked, when attempting to load from the external txt file), that said hopefully this is a simple fix
Ewari/Ilja — 06/05/2023 06:03
On my next day off I will finish all the content on the home page and have it styled
Tupd — 10/05/2023 11:31
It might help if either of you turn up next week so that it becomes possible to attempt finish of the project
soma — 10/05/2023 11:35
We can book a room in library I think
Tupd — 10/05/2023 11:35
*additionally who is doing the documentation, and that said if it is a complete collaborative item,  it is highly difficult to add to it if there currently seems to be nothing there. 
soma — 10/05/2023 11:37
Idk if i should use the stuff i had in my google doc
because its created by gpt
Tupd — 15/05/2023 16:43
