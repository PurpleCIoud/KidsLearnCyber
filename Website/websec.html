            Social media has become an integral part of our daily lives. <br/>
            It is a great way to stay connected with friends and family, share our thoughts and ideas,
            and stay up-to-date with the latest news and trends. <br/>
            However, social media can also be a dangerous place if we are not careful. <br/>
            Here are some tips that secondary school students can use to protect themselves on social media:<br/>
            <br/>
            Use privacy settings across social media platforms to manage your digital footprint.<br/>
            Privacy settings are an essential tool for managing your digital footprint on social media.<br/>
            They allow you to control who can see your posts, photos, and other personal information. <br/>
            By using privacy settings, you can ensure that only your friends and family can see your posts and photos.<br/>
            This can help protect you from cyberbullying, harassment, and other online threats.<br/>
            <br/>
            Be careful about what you share online.<br/>
            Once you post something online, it can be difficult or impossible to remove it.<br/>
            This is why it is important to be careful about what you share online.<br/>
            Before posting anything on social media, ask yourself if it
            is something that you would want your parents or teachers to see. If the answer is no, then don’t post it.<br/>
            <br/>
            Be aware of the risks of sextortion scams and how to protect yourself from them.<br/>
            Sextortion scams are a growing problem on social media. <br/>
            They involve criminals using fake profiles to trick people into sending them explicit photos or videos.<br/>
            Once they have these photos or videos, they use them to blackmail their victims into sending
            them money or more explicit content.<br/>
            To protect yourself from sextortion scams, never send explicit photos or videos to anyone online,
            even if you think you know them.<br/>
            <br/>
            Be cautious when accepting friend requests from people you don’t know.<br/>
            One of the most common ways that criminals target people on social
            media is by creating fake profiles and sending friend requests to people they don’t know. <br/>
            Once they have accepted the friend request, they can use the information on your profile to steal
            your identity or commit other crimes.<br/>
            To protect yourself from these types of scams, be cautious when
            accepting friend requests from people you don’t know.<br/>
            <br/>
            Don’t share your passwords with anyone.<br/>
            Your password is the key to your online identity.<br/>
            If someone else has access to your password, they can log into your accounts and steal your personal information.<br/>
            To protect yourself from this type of attack, never share your passwords with anyone.<br/>
            <br/>
            Use strong passwords and two-factor authentication whenever possible.<br/>
            Strong passwords are essential for protecting your online accounts from hackers and other cybercriminals. <br/>
            A strong password should be at least 12 characters long and include a mix of upper and lowercase letters,
            numbers, and symbols. Two-factor authentication is another essential tool for protecting your online accounts.<br/>
            It requires you to enter a code sent to your phone or email in addition to your password when logging into an account.<br/>
