      Personal information is any data that can identify or relate to a specific individual,
      such as name, address, phone number, email, bank details, health records, etc.<br/>
      Personal information is valuable for many purposes, such as communication, commerce,
      education, health care, social media, etc.<br/>
      However, personal information can also be misused by cyber criminals who may try to steal,
      manipulate or destroy it for their own gain. <br/>
      Therefore, it is important to protect personal information from cyber threats
      and ensure its confidentiality, integrity and availability.<br/>
      <br/>
      Cyber security is the means by which individuals and organisations
      reduce the risk of being affected by cyber crime. <br/>
      Cyber security’s core function is to protect the devices we all use (smartphones, laptops, tablets and computers),
      and the services we access online - both at home and work - from theft or damage. <br/>
      It’s also about preventing unauthorised access to the vast amounts of
      personal information we store on these devices, and online.<br/>
      <br/>
      Cyber security is important because smartphones, computers and the internet
      are now such a fundamental part of modern life, that it’s difficult to imagine how we’d function without them.<br/>
      From online banking and shopping, to email and social media, it’s more important than ever to take steps
      that can prevent cyber criminals getting hold of our accounts, data, and devices.<br/>
      <br/>
      Some of the ways to protect personal information and enhance cyber security are:<br/>
      <br/>
      Use a strong and separate password for your email and other online accounts.<br/>
      You can use a password manager to help you create and store passwords securely. <br/>
      Passwords are the first line of defence against unauthorised access to your accounts and data. <br/>
      Using weak or reused passwords can make it easy for cyber criminals to guess or crack them. <br/>
      Password managers are applications that generate and store
      complex passwords for you, so you don’t have to remember them or write them down.<br/>
      Install the latest software and app updates on your devices. <br/>
      They often contain important security fixes that can protect you from cyber attacks.<br/>
      Software and app updates are not just about adding new features or improving performance.<br/>
      They also fix vulnerabilities that cyber criminals can exploit to
      infect your devices with malware or gain access to your data.<br/>
      Installing updates as soon as they are available can reduce the risk of being compromised by known threats.<br/>
      Turn on 2-Step Verification (2SV) for your online accounts that offer it.<br/>
      This adds an extra layer of security by asking you to enter a code or use a device when you log in.<br/>
      2SV is also known as two-factor authentication (2FA) or multi-factor authentication (MFA).<br/>
      It requires you to provide something you know (such as a password)
      and something you have (such as a code sent to your phone or a device like a security key)
      when you log in to your online accounts.<br/>
      This makes it harder for cyber criminals to access your accounts even if they have your password.<br/>
      Back up your data regularly to an external hard drive or a cloud service. <br/>
      This can help you recover your important files if you are affected by ransomware or other malware. <br/>
      Ransomware is a type of malware that encrypts your data and demands a ransom for its decryption.<br/>
      Other malware can delete or corrupt your data without your knowledge.<br/>
      Backing up your data means making copies of it and
      storing them in a separate location from your device, such as an external hard drive or a cloud service. <br/>
      This way, you can restore your data if you lose access to it on your device.<br/>
      Protect your data in transit and at rest by using encryption and authentication. <br/>
      This can prevent unauthorised access, modification or deletion of your data. <br/>
      Encryption is a process that transforms data into an unreadable form that can only be decrypted with a key.<br/>
      Authentication is a process that verifies the identity of a user or a device before granting access to data or services. <br/>
      Encryption and authentication can protect your data when it is being
      transferred over the internet (in transit) or when it is stored on your device or elsewhere (at rest).<br/>
      This can prevent cyber criminals from intercepting, altering or deleting your data.<br/>
      Sanitise or destroy your storage media after use, so that sensitive data cannot be recovered from them. <br/>
      Storage media are devices that store data, such as hard drives, USB sticks, memory cards, etc.<br/>
      When you delete data from these devices, it may not be completely erased and can still be recovered with special tools. <br/>
      Sanitising or destroying storage media means applying methods that make the data irretrievable,
      such as overwriting it with random data (sanitising) or physically damaging it (destroying).<br/>
      This can prevent cyber criminals from accessing your data if they get hold of your storage media.<br/>
      Assess your cyber security arrangements against relevant good practice models,
      such as NCSC 10 Steps to Cyber Security, ISO27001 for Information Security, and NIST Cyber Security Framework. <br/>
      These are frameworks that provide guidance on how to implement effective cyber security measures in organisations
      of different sizes and sectors.<br/>
      They cover various aspects of cyber security management, such as risk assessment, governance, policies,
      procedures, controls, monitoring, incident response, etc. <br/>
      Assessing your cyber security arrangements against these frameworks can help you identify
      gaps and areas for improvement in your current practices.<br/>
      Report any cyber security incidents to the NCSC or other relevant authorities,
      so that they can help you and other organisations prevent similar attacks. <br/>
      Cyber security incidents are events that compromise the confidentiality, integrity or availability of your data or systems.<br/>
      Examples include phishing emails, malware infections, denial-of-service attacks ,data breaches ,etc.<br/>
      Reporting cyber security incidents can help the NCSC or other authorities analyse the
      threats and provide advice on how to mitigate them. <br/>
      It can also help them share information and best practices with other organisations that may be affected by similar incidents.<br/>
      In conclusion,<br/>
      <br/>
      Personal information is essential for many aspects of modern life but also vulnerable to cyber threats.<br/>
      Cyber security is vital for protecting personal information from cyber crime and ensuring its proper use and management.<br/>
      There are various ways to enhance cyber security at both individual
      and organisational levels by following some simple steps and good practices.<br/>
