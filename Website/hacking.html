            Be suspicious of any email or message that asks you to provide personal information or click on a link.<br/>
            Phishing is a common tactic used by cyber criminals to steal personal information such as passwords,
            credit card numbers, and bank account details. They often use emails or messages that appear to be from
            legitimate sources such as banks, social media sites, or online retailers.<br/>
            These emails or messages may ask you to provide personal information or click on a link that takes you to a
            fake website where you are asked to enter your personal information.<br/>
            To avoid falling victim to phishing attacks, it is important to be suspicious of any email or message that
            asks you to provide personal information or click on a link.<br/>
            <br/>
            Check the sender’s email address or phone number to make sure it’s legitimate. One way to identify phishing
            emails is to check the sender’s email address or phone number.<br/>
            Cyber criminals often use fake email addresses or phone numbers that appear to be from legitimate sources.<br/>
            To avoid falling victim to these types of attacks, it is important to check the sender’s email address or
            phone number before responding to any emails or messages.<br/>
            <br/>
            Don’t click on links or download attachments from unknown sources. Another way cyber criminals use phishing
            attacks is by sending emails or messages with links or attachments that contain malware.<br/>
            This malware can infect your computer and steal your personal information.<br/>
            To avoid falling victim to these types of attacks,
            it is important not to click on links or download attachments from unknown sources.<br/>
            <br/>
            Use anti-virus software and keep it up-to-date.
            Anti-virus software can help protect your computer from malware and other types of cyber attacks.<br/>
            It is important to use anti-virus software and keep it up-to-date to ensure that your
            computer is protected against the latest threats.<br/>
            <br/>
            Use strong passwords and don’t share them with anyone.<br/>
            Using strong passwords can help protect your online accounts from cyber attacks. <br/>
            It is important to use a combination of letters,
            numbers, and symbols when creating passwords and not share them with anyone.<br/>
            <br/>
            Use two-factor authentication whenever possible.
            Two-factor authentication adds an extra layer of security to your online accounts by requiring a second form
            of identification in addition to your password. This can help protect your accounts from cyber attacks.<br/>
            <br/>
            Be cautious when using public Wi-Fi networks. <br/>
            Public Wi-Fi networks are often unsecured and can be easily hacked by cyber criminals. <br/>
            It is important to be cautious when using public Wi-Fi networks and avoid accessing
            sensitive information such as bank accounts or credit card numbers.
